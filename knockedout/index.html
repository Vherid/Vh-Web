                <h2>Knocked Out - A Game of Fighting Armored Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Knocked Out is a generative, traditional pen and paper game played from the perspective of crewmen in armored fighting vehicles. In any era from early war light tanks of WWII to mobile anti-air platforms in a "Cold War Gone Hot" scenario, Knocked Out supports it. Players will take a platoon or company of AFVs through a campaign of missions where events and encounters are all randomly generated, creating a different story with every play-through. A focus on complex, detailed results prevents the fiery action from becoming repetitive. With every roll of the dice lies a new tree of possibilities. The system can be played solitaire or with a group of friends, each controlling their own AFV and a Game Master controlling the flow of the campaign.</p>
