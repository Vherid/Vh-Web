                <h2>Knocked Out - A Game of Fighting Armored Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Knocked Out is a generative, traditional pen and paper game played from the perspective of crewmen in armored fighting vehicles. In any era from early war light tanks of WWII to mobile anti-air platforms in a "Cold War Gone Hot" scenario, Knocked Out supports it. Players will take a platoon or company of AFVs through a campaign of missions where events and encounters are all randomly generated, creating a different story with every play-through. A focus on complex, detailed results prevents the fiery action from becoming repetitive. With every roll of the dice lies a new tree of possibilities. The system can be played solitaire or with a group of friends, each controlling their own AFV and a Game Master controlling the flow of the campaign.</p>

                        <h2>What are Wargames</h2>
                        <p>Wargames came into general existence in the late 18th century, under the name of Kriegsspiel in the Prussian armies. As time went on and the games became more realistic, it started to become a commonplace training item for Prussian leaders. It is widely believed that these wargames are one of the big reasons that led to Prussian dominance over France in the 2nd Franco-Prussian war.</p>
                        <p>Today they are still used in a multitude of reasons, including the continued use of simulation and training with military leaders. Militaries of numerous nations today use wargames in all sorts of scales: single person, teams pitted against each other, or even full scale wargames such as Able Archer which almost started World War III in 1983.</p>
                        <p>However, beyond military use, they are also heavily used for purposes of entertainment and education. Sometimes wargamers just want to play out the events of the Normandy beach landings casually, or sometimes people use wargames competitively in tournaments. Maybe someone want's to learn about Operation Market Garden, by playing a wargame about it, they would learn about the massive and failed airdrop operation of Allied forces in World War II.</p>

                        <h2>Computer Wargames</h2>
                        <p>A few years back, I had started playing computer wargames. Games like Combat Mission, Close Combat, WinSPMBT/WinSPWW2, Panzer General/Panzer Corps, Achtung Panzer, Graviteam Tactics, Steel Armor Beasts of War, Steel Beasts, DCS, ARMA, the list just goes on and on. This in combination with the idea of playing extremely complex game systems from more years prior, like Dwarf Fortress, and a love of military history I started really getting into the idea of playing out complex systems based on realistic data and statistics to sort of recreate epic battle scenes like some sort of war movie.</p>

                        <h2>Traditional Wargames</h2>
                        <p>This eventually led to digging into traditional wargames from the 70-90's. Game companies like Avalon Hill, SPI/S&T, GMT, and others have created insanely wide ranges of games covering any sort of era or scale throughout war history, be it strategic scale controlling entire dynasties in feudal Japan, or managing the entire logistical line of supplies on the eastern front of World War II, or whether it's tactical scale engagements, controlling single soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam, and everything in between.</p>

                    <h2>The Ultimate Wargame</h2>
                    <p>Of course a line like that drew me towards the wargame, Advanced Squad Leader. As someone with a lot of interest in war history, World War II is arguably the most interesting and probably biggest out of any other war in terms of size and information. I had heard stories about this game from a few people in some places, basically hearing about the insanity of detail which of course drew me in more.</p>
