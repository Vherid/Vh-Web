                <h2>Kriegsspiel - A Thesis Proposal of Conflict Simulation through Complex Systems</h2>
                <p>Wargaming has a long and important history of cultural impact in this world. Stemming from the 18th Century, wargaming has been employed by many nations for leadership training and conflict simulation as well as historical education and recreation. By applying the concepts of systems and game theory in the context of conflict simulation, I seek to delve into the various complications of creating a ruleset that tackles the various challenges and problems that arise from abstracting real life scenarios into realistic but fun simulations. The goal of simulating reality for these applications would be to recreate historical or hypothetical situations for learning, competitive, and casual purposes; broken down in ways that are of better understanding. By delving into and creating these systems, for my degree project I hope to produce a playable system that will be realistic, fun, and easy to understand and acquire.</p>

                        <h2>What are Wargames</h2>
                        <p>Wargames came into general existence in the late 18th century, under the name of Kriegsspiel in the Prussian armies. As time went on and the games became more realistic, it started to become a commonplace training item for Prussian leaders. It is widely believed that these wargames are one of the big reasons that led to Prussian dominance over France in the 2nd Franco-Prussian war.</p>
                        <p>Today they are still used in a multitude of reasons, including the continued use of simulation and training with military leaders. Militaries of numerous nations today use wargames in all sorts of scales: single person, teams pitted against each other, or even full scale wargames such as Able Archer which almost started World War III in 1983.</p>
                        <p>However, beyond military use, they are also heavily used for purposes of entertainment and education. Sometimes wargamers just want to play out the events of the Normandy beach landings casually, or sometimes people use wargames competitively in tournaments. Maybe someone want's to learn about Operation Market Garden, by playing a wargame about it, they would learn about the massive and failed airdrop operation of Allied forces in World War II.</p>

                        <h2>Computer Wargames</h2>
                        <p>A few years back, I had started playing computer wargames. Games like Combat Mission, Close Combat, WinSPMBT/WinSPWW2, Panzer General/Panzer Corps, Achtung Panzer, Graviteam Tactics, Steel Armor Beasts of War, Steel Beasts, DCS, ARMA, the list just goes on and on. This in combination with the idea of playing extremely complex game systems from more years prior, like Dwarf Fortress, and a love of military history I started really getting into the idea of playing out complex systems based on realistic data and statistics to sort of recreate epic battle scenes like some sort of war movie.</p>

                        <h2>Traditional Wargames</h2>
                        <p>This eventually led to digging into traditional wargames from the 70-90's. Game companies like Avalon Hill, SPI/S&T, GMT, and others have created insanely wide ranges of games covering any sort of era or scale throughout war history, be it strategic scale controlling entire dynasties in feudal Japan, or managing the entire logistical line of supplies on the eastern front of World War II, or whether it's tactical scale engagements, controlling single soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam, and everything in between.</p>

                    <h2>The Ultimate Wargame</h2>
                    <p>Of course a line like that drew me towards the wargame, Advanced Squad Leader. As someone with a lot of interest in war history, World War II is arguably the most interesting and probably biggest out of any other war in terms of size and information. I had heard stories about this game from a few people in some places, basically hearing about the insanity of detail which of course drew me in more.</p>
                    <h2>I Wasn't Ready</h2>
                    <p>This game had been out since 1985 and had spawned so many expansion modules, historical scenario modules, bonus action packs, as well as numerous third party companies creating all sorts of sets of various things for the game. To say the least, getting into the game now, has you way behind. Every component is incredibly expensive, almost every component requires you to own a prior dependent and at least half of the modules across the board are out of print, and have been for at least five years. If you merely wanted to play Pacific Theatre scenarios, you would need to spend around $400-$500 but good luck even being able to find all the pieces needed anyways.</p>
                    <p>The rules were indeed complex as well, considering the base rulebook itself ran around 350 pages, with 4 core chapters, each about 70 pages long explaining a different chunk of the game. For example, the first chapter, Chapter A, covers the base game rules, and Infantry rules. 70 pages of extremely dense reading and you can't even use support guns, ordanance, or vehicles of any kind yet.</p>
                    <h2>Grognards, Audience of</h2>
                    <p>A grognard is someone who would be considered an ultra-hardcore wargamer. They like to play some of the most complex systems out there, some of them taking months of reading and learning just to start playing the game with the simplest mechanics, never mind moving on to more advanced techniques. <strong>Someone once also told me as a joke that a grognard was a type of game where you spent more time looking at the rulebook while playing, than playing the game itself.</strong> This can be true of most of these games, but there’s just something in this niche of wargames that really appeal to this group of people. They like data-density, they love complicated mechanics, and they love having every possible degree of detail being present in a system. They don’t want simple binary results like yes/no, they want fifty possible variations of yes and no.</p>

            <img src="img/aslboard.png" alt="Advanced Squad Leader Scenario Play">
            <h6>ASL is also incredibly complex, despite being at a "smaller" tactical scale. The game has an entire page or two devoted just to the mechanics of flammability of terrain types, how fires spread, how wind speed and direction affect them, and how and where smoke drifts according to such, as well as how thick the smoke is at any given turn.</h6>

            <h6>A handful of my scrawlings for different game systems, mostly 1033 and Voroshilov.</h6>
            <p>I decided that with all of these problems, that I would rather just make my own game. The system employed by MMP in their control of ASL actually frustrated me so much that I wanted something done, and it would be better to do it myself.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Project Potato Mashers</h2>
                <p>Like Advanced Squad Leader, the first idea I gravitated towards was to create a company scale, World War II, tactical game. I started building influences and working on what sort of mechanics and systems to add to my game, and then I finally managed to play a couple games of ASL. ASL turned out to be one of the most fun games I have ever played in my life, and I realized that it really was the ultimate wargame. For me to make my own system, would be counter productive because one, I wouldn't want to play it, if ASL was really that much better, and two, I also found out there are hundreds of other similar systems already out there, some of them already derivative from ASL. This idea was quickly scrapped, though all the notes still exist just incase.</p>
                <h2>Project 1033</h2>
                <p>Project 1033 was my next main idea where I was likened to the idea of building a small scale tactical game about the conflicts between say barricaded suspects and SWAT teams. This eventually evolved to cover more than just simple criminals and police, but ideally any sort of BLUFOR v. REDFOR situation, SWAT breaking apart bank heists, South American secret police invading banana republic dictator houses, etc. A lot of notes, ideas, and mechanics were put together for this game, more than Potato Mashers, but I feared the scope of the game and what I could currently do wouldn't cut it, so I started looking elsewhere.</p>
                <h2>Project Voroshilov</h2>
                <p>I finally managed to see the movie, Fury, and it really put the idea into my head of something along the lines of "Why on earth is there not already a game like this?". Well it eventually turned out Avalon Hill did make a game with the same sort of inner-crew focus and single tank premise that the movie followed called "Patton's Best", but at the time I wasn't aware and couldn't find it at all. I started building out this game, and this is what became Knocked Out.</p>

            <h6>Stylized image of a Soviet T-34/76 with "Rodina" or Motherland on it's turret.</h6>
            <p>After solidifying my idea, the next objective was to build out as much as the game prototype as I possibly could with these key traits.</p>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Narrative Generation</h2>
                <p>Some of the games I have played feature a lot of random/procedural generation as well as narrative creating mechanics. These sorts of things tended to pull in a lot of outside interest, as even those not interested in playing the game itself for whatever reasons, were very if not more interested in the stories that came out of the game. Thus I wanted this to be a game in the same vein as I found those sorts of systems to be very interesting. Instead of getting a bunch of unlucky rolls and going, "Well I just suck today.", you could now look at the rolls, the situation, and any other context and begin to piece together a story to be told after the game was done being played. A platoon of russian tankers all roll horribly, well maybe there's a story element of them all being fresh conscripts now.</p>
                <h2>Chaos</h2>
                <p>A large portion of the game had to be randomly determined by dice rolls. This would create the maximum amount of unique runs for each and every single playthrough despite how similar the setup was. A slightly different roll in one spot could drastically alter the outcome of the entire run.</p>
                <h2>Complex Detail</h2>
                <p>The system also had to produce at least some of the details in complexity of warfare. I had been far more interested in games that didn't just give simple, "Dead" or "Okay" results. I wanted more systems where an incomming shell didn't just destroy a tank or not, but rather explain that the shell pierced the frontal hull through the driver's vision slit, ripped the driver apart, smashed the engine, bounced back and hit an ammo rack which exploded the entire tank.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="column6">
                <h2>Easy to Obtain</h2>
                <p>Unlike ASL and numerous other systems already out there, I wanted this to be very easy and cheap to obtain. Simple print and play sheets to play would be all that was needed, with easily accesible rules online or for print as well. If the system ever ends up reaching a point of being sellable, it would be extremely cheap and by not depending on official publisher/printers but rather buyer printing, theres no risk of it ever running out of print.</p>
                <h2>Balance of Understanding</h2>
                <p>While I wanted an extreme amount of complex details, it also had to be easier to understand to less serious gamers who were interested, and also ease new players into the system instead of suddenly dropping 600 pages of rules onto them and/or greatly bogging the system down with a million checks. The complexity v. accesibility struggle was probably the most active in terms of balancing the system as it stands so far.</p>

                <h1>The System Basis</h1>
                <img src="img/KnockedOutT34.png" alt="Knocked Out Background">
                <h6>Stylized image of a knocked out T-34/76.</h6>
                <h2>Knocked Out - A Game of Fighting Armored Vehicles</h2>
                <p>Knocked Out is a generative, traditional pen and paper game played from the perspective of crewmen in armored fighting vehicles. In any era from early war light tanks of WWII to mobile anti-air platforms in a "Cold War Gone Hot" scenario, Knocked Out supports it. Players will take a platoon or company of AFVs through a campaign of missions where events and encounters are all randomly generated, creating a different story with every play-through. A focus on complex, detailed results prevents the fiery action from becoming repetitive. With every roll of the dice lies a new tree of possibilities. The system can be played solitaire or with a group of friends, each controlling their own AFV and a Game Master controlling the flow of the campaign.</p>
                <h2>How RNG(Random Number Generation) is Used</h2>
                <p>A key component of the game as previously stated, is random and procedural generation. Missions and enemies included will all be randomly generated, with the option to generate even more things such as your own platoon’s force composition. A platoon of Sherman tanks most likely did not all have Easy Eights. Maybe one tank is an E8, while the rest are regular Shermans. Or in a Russian T34 platoon, you might get one T-34-85, and 2 T-34/76’s. One might be the 1941 model, one might be the 1943 model. Of course these sorts of compositions depending on a LOT of things beyond just general availability and production times, such as company/division/batallion location, prestige, urgency, ass-kissing, supply line strength, etc. In reality once the T-34/85 and further down the road, IS-2, really came into mass production, mostly everyone had it. It's a little more fun with a more varied composition however, and again, adds some story elements, like for example, this platoon kept it's first tank all this time as a lucky charm.</p>
                <p>Random dice rolls are used to generate almost everything about each mission, which you will see in the user scenario, the crew you get, the type of mission you will embark on for the day, where it takes place, what the enemy composition will consist of, etc. Pretty much everything that isn't of your control is randomly determined.</p>
                <h2>Perspective</h2>
                <p>Also stated previously, is the inner-crew focus of the game. Combat in relation to your own vehicle and crew is incredibly detailed and brutal, as is their perspective of it. Damage to enemy or other allied systems will be far more simpler as your crew surely won’t so easily see the extent of the damage to others. For example, when your AFV is hit by a round, lots of rolls are thrown to detemine exactly what systems it destroys if it even pens the armor at all, who it might kill, and other various things. When you shoot at an enemy, it's a simple armor pen check, and then a simple kill check, as is all the crew would see.</p>
                <p>Nation wise, Era wise, the system should be able to really cover anything as long as stats and rules are built out or homebrewed for them. For the prototype I had to narrow the idea down to WW2, and to the big players of WW2, Mainly USA, Soviet Union, and Germany. With infinte time and power, the other players of WW2, UK/Commonwealth, France, Czech Republic, Italy, Japan, Poland, China, etc. could be done. Further more, also going beyond World War II.</p>

                <h2>Phase A: Setting Up</h2>
                <p>This first phase consists of picking a theatre, nation, and time period. After that’s narrowed down, you will pick or randomly roll for your AFVs. Then crews are generated and the availability of supplies are determined.</p>
                <h2>Phase B: Garage Duties</h2>
                <p>This is where general management of crew and vehicles takes place, as well as supplies, repairs and upgrades from the outside world. Replacements for both crew and vehicle would also take place here.</p>
                <h2>Phase C: Mission</h2>
                <p>Simple, you generate a mission, and you play that mission.</p>
                <h2>Phase D: Results</h2>
                <p>The results of the mission are analyzed and wrapped up.</p>
                <h2>Phase E: Campaign Advancement</h2>
                <p>Time is moved forward, and big picture aspects are examined and compared to where you stand. After this phase, you return to garage duties and repeat the process from there all over again.</p>

                <h6>Diagram of a Sherman Tank.</h6>
                <h2>What is a Tank</h2>
                <p>Consider the diagram above. When a shell hits a tank, right off the bat it has only two places to technically hit in it's most abstract: The Hull and the Turret. Let’s say it hits the hull. On the hull the next immediate layer would be the Armor, Suspension/Tracks System, or any Personnel, Riders, or Crew not inside. If it hits the Armor, then it could hit the Engine, Radio, Fuel, Internal Crew, Vision systems such as parascopes or gun sights, the Armament itself, Ammo Racks, Controls, Batteris, etc.</p>
                <p>As you can see, the tank is a complicated piece of machinery. The goal in such a small scale focused game is not to simply find out whether a tank has been knocked out or not. But rather to see exactly why is has been knocked out. The audience wants to hear how an enemy shell smashed through the turret and bounced down into an ammo rack and exploded the whole tank.</p>
