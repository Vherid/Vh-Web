		<h2>Year 4/5 - Graphic Design</h2>
		<p>My goals for this semester would be to simply put a heavier focus into my school work than I have previously over the years. I have an interest in Web Design and would like to really apply myself to it this semester and take the more advanced course next semester as well. I also plan on improving myself mentally and physically, but that is something of a goal that will carry on for the next two years.</p>
