                    <h2>A minimal, wide audience targeted site about the Ebola epidemic that surfaced in 2014, providing factual information on how to avoid and combat it.</h2>
                    <p>Originally created as an Ebola infographic project, the site was made to provide all the current and factual information on the outbreak, and furthermore allow it to be used by as large of a population as possible. In a large majority of Africa, Internet Explorer and Opera are still very popular browsers, and therefore limitations were placed upon bloated CSS frameworks and the use of any sort of interactive Javascript, as speed on any system was a key goal.</p>
                    <p>The color of yellow was chosen as a main spot color based on African associations with the color being related to Intellect, Optimism, Hope, Communication of New Ideas, Caution/Warning, and Attention Grabbing. Furthermore gold represents the sun in Guinea flag. Yellow on the Senegal flag represents wealth, product of work for a nation of economic progress priority. Also means arts, literature, and intellect. Based on all of this, I decided it was a good choice.</p>
                    <p>The first version of the site was entirely yellow, which was a bit more bold, but also possibly more eye straining. In the newer version of the site, I went with a more regular off-white BG color, but kept the landing splash the bold yellow after some suggestions. The type was also moved to a regular caps set instead of the always all-caps Bebas. The nav bar that was poorly implemented in the original was also removed and kept to the idea of just keeping it a one-page scroll, but an easier scroll as the older site had a lot of scrolling space in between each section, to the point of it almost being a chore to scroll down to the next chunk.</p>
                    <p>The grid system was also changed to a more lightweight and simpler system, and in the end, the site came together a lot more with the current version. The look was more scientific and informational instead of being just a little too bold and scary.</p>

            <p>This was a relatively easy touch up, all the algorithms created in processing were already done prior, and all that was simply needed was a place to house the examples. A few attempts were made to house the actual processing scripts themselves into canvas items on the page, but some of them slowed the site down by far too much and thus, gif animations of the scripts were recorded to showcase instead.</p>

                <h2>A huge heap of dev issues.</h2>
                <p>This site, dev wise was probably the biggest pain in the ass out of all of the other projects. As a long 6 week project in Pascal's Advanced Web class from a year ago, it had problems even then and was never 100% finished. The creation of a JS shopping cart from scratch proved to be more difficult than expected when I tried to pair it with this idea of this point buy system in the vein of character creators.</p>
                <img src="img/angular.png" alt="Angular course completed">
                <p>After numerous struggles to revisit the code of the site and fix it, I decided to basically scrap and rebuild from scratch, while also learning and then implementing the Angular JS library.</p>
                <p>After completing Code School's course which acts as an introduction to Angular, I actually put this site on the back burner and moved on to other projects instead and got more to grips with the framework that way. Near the end when I did revisit the project, I wanted to implement a form submission idea instead of doing the out of place "shopping cart". Unfortunately due to time constraints, and still not being super proficient with Angular, it proved it would be too much a challenge with the time left to have a fully working functional prototype. So in the end, it was made as a visual prototype with some interaction and display driven by Angular.</p>

                <h2>The weather is ugly.</h2>
                <p>Weather.com has turned into this disgusting pit of despair lately. When you visit the site now, it seems only 30% of the screen is actually dedicated to your weather interests, while the rest is filled with social media crap that has nothing to do with weather, and advertisements. Furthermore, most of the site is clickbait titled, and it is full of visual noise.</p>
                <p>I set out to redesign the page with the goals of getting rid of all the social media junk, cutting down on visual noise until needed, and making sure that dangerous weather was indeed front and center. For the local weather page I also gave the user the entire page to see info about the local weather instead of small chunks at a time squished at the top of the screen. The design is made with a 12 column grid, based off the recent 1140px grid idea.</p>

                <h2>Building a clicker game.</h2>
                <p>After learning the Angular JS framework I realized how easy it would be to start digging into the design and development of a incremental/idle/clicker game. The goal of these games are stupid and simple. You merely click a button or object, and gain a resource from doing so. Over time you are able to start buying things that basically click or gain those resources for you, and even further down the road you can then upgrade those units to make their "clicks" stronger, or even buildings that slowly now generate those units. They can get exceedingly ridiculous and as you can imagine, incremental. You start out with nothing, you end up with a massive sprawling empire of whatever the game is about.</p>
                <p>I had several ideas to tackle this, originally I wanted to put together a game that was about running the pure diabolical entity of a dreaded office space, Starting with one software engineer and slowly building up to a multinational empire of cubicles. However eventually I moved on to the idea of building and managing a small army, in world war 2. I originally wanted to do a Volksgrenadier company and it's various challenges of pushing into Russia, but decided in the end of instead running a Soviet Shock Rifle Battalion.</p>
                <p>The over-arching ideas was to have glory as the main spending resource. Acts of valor in combat gain glory, so by clicking you gain glory, and eventually you are gathering an army to gain glory for you. You spend that glory to requisition more units. Units spend supplies to get glory so you also need units that don't really get a lot of glory, but manage your supply lines, IE, administrative units. Furthermore down the road you would eventually get vehicles which are much stronger, but would need to spend fuel to gather the glory. Unit effectiveness goes down if supplies and fuel go negative so management of supplies is important. You can also upgrade units to increase their effectiveness. A similar negative resource, casualties was also planned but did not fit the prototype.</p>

                <h2>The IIFT</h2>
                <p>What started as a random self-project to create a functional IIFT roller out of my wargaming passion that is Advanced Squad Leader, turned into a more complete project. Again, after learning Angular, I had this idea of making an app that could tackle the IIFT chart, and automatically give you results from the chart based on user input data, and computer rolled dice. Overall it would make going through the chart way easier and quicker as well, as it is a massively complex piece of work.</p>
                <img src="img/iiftchart.png" alt="ASL IIFT chart">
                <p>You would have to first figure out all of the added firepower of an attacking unit, use that column on the chart, roll the dice, and use that row in a cross reference to a combat result. However, the columns or rows you used shifted further based on any sort of defensive or offensive modifiers to the dice roll number, and furthermore if you did something like roll doubles, the unit cowers and the FP column is shifted to the left a certain amount.</p>
                <img src="img/iiftresult.png" alt="IIFT Result Example">
                <h6>Example of results from rolling in the app.</h6>
                <p>It took a good chunk of time to properly develop the code for the application, and further work eventually went into making it more visually pleasing. Originally it was just the IIFT table, but a tool was also added to simplify figuring out Close Combat ratios and rolling results for that instead of going through complicated CC tables to figure out proper ratio numbers.</p>
