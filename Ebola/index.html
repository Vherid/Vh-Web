          <h2>What is Ebola?</h2>
          <body>Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). Also known as Ebola Virus Disease(EVD), or Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever(EHF).</body>

          <body>As of Feb. 2015, the Ebola outbreak is currently within Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. There were also minor cases in Nigeria, the Madrid area of spain, the Bamako area of Mali, and the Dallas/NYC areas of the US. These other cases were imported cases, and minimal contacts. There has been at least 42 days since any new reports of confirmed cases in those minor imported case areas. There has also been a travel associated case in the Dakar area of Senegal. Scotland and England have also recently seen import cases in the UK.</body>
