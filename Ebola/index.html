                <h2>What is Ebola?</h2>

                <p>Ebola is a severe, often fatal disease in humans and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees). Also known as Ebola Virus Disease(EVD), or Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever(EHF).</p>

                <h2>How does it function?</h2>

                <p>The disease starts with influenza like symptoms, but soon leads to bleeding from any location on the p, and eventually multiple organ failure.</p>

                <h2>What are the dangers of Ebola?</h2>

                <p>Ebola is highly contagious, and while not airbourne, is transmitted via bodily fluids. The disease currently holds an average of a 50% fatality rate and is currently untreatable, though symptoms may be managed, and some have recovered through intensive care. </p>

                <p>Timely treatment of Ebola is important but challenging since the disease is difficult to diagnose clinically in the early stages of infection. Because early symptoms such as headache and fever are not specific to Ebolaviruses, cases of Ebola may be initially misdiagnosed. With these three symptom interventions chances of survival can be significantly increased.</p>

                <p>As of Feb. 2015, the Ebola outbreak is currently within Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. There were also minor cases in Nigeria, the Madrid area of spain, the Bamako area of Mali, and the Dallas/NYC areas of the US. These other cases were imported cases, and minimal contacts. There has been at least 42 days since any new reports of confirmed cases in those minor imported case areas. There has also been a travel associated case in the Dakar area of Senegal. Scotland and England have also recently seen import cases in the UK.</p>
